# LaTeX Templates

While studying at uni I found it much easier to write math, computing and engineering assignments using LaTeX.

I didn't have any experience with LaTeX, so I decided to store small templates/snippets of code for things such as graphs, tables, formulas, item lists etc to be used in future assignments.

In this repo there are all of the snippets/templates I've been using, and I am continuing on adding more.

### Project Structure 

The project structure is as follows:

```
latex-templates/
├── README.md
└── templates/
    └── template-title/
        └── template-title.tex
        └── template-title.pdf
        └── template-title.png
        └── README.md
```
        
Each template contains:
- The source `.tex` file which includes comments and information about the template's contents.
- A PDF of the `.tex` output.
- A PNG of the `.tex` output.
- A README.md of the PNG
